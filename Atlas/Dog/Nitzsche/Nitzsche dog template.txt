There is a good template article published in 2018, 
   "A stereotaxic breed-averaged, symmetric T2w canine brain atlas including detailed morphological and volumetrical data sets", https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29407456)

and it's associated website where templates can be download from:
  http://animal-brain-mapping.com

As till this time we don't have a paper about our normalization process (based on Barney's brain), if one would like to refer to a brain area (or a reviewer requires a published reference), there is a choice:

You can find on the NAS a folder (Z:\fMRI\fájlok_scanner\3. Barney template) which is called "Nitzsche_dog_template", and I put into this folder:
  - the above mentioned article from Björn Nitzsche;
  - the dog template which is available on their website (I named it "Nitzsche_dog_template (NDT).nii");
  - and our Barney template file, which I normalized to the NDT template: "TPL_Barney_transformed_to_NDT.nii"

So in this way if you want to refer an MNI coordinate which is in accordance with the Nitzsche's tempalte, you can use this  transformed Barney file during the normalization process.

I hope it helps.
If you have any question regarding to it, feel free to ask :)
Best,
